# Deployment Options Comparison

## Current Situation

Your Kusto MCP server **requires Node.js**, but your current Azure App Service deployment uses **Oryx** (code-based deployment) with a **Python-only runtime**.

## ✅ Solution: You Have 2 Options

### Option 1: Docker Container Deployment (RECOMMENDED)

**What it is:** Deploy a custom Docker container with **both Python 3.11 AND Node.js 22 LTS**.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Kusto MCP server works perfectly (Node.js available)
- ✅ Same environment locally and in production
- ✅ Full control over dependencies and runtime
- ✅ Easy to test locally: `docker-compose up`
- ✅ Portable - runs anywhere Docker runs
- ✅ Already implemented! (see `Dockerfile`)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Slightly longer build time (builds entire image)
- ⚠️ Requires Azure to be configured for container deployment

**Setup Required:**
1. Enable container deployment in Azure (one-time)
2. Configure GitHub Container Registry (automatic via GitHub Actions)
3. Push code - GitHub Actions builds and deploys container

**Files Created:**
- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build
- ✅ `.dockerignore` - Optimize build
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Local testing
- ✅ `.github/workflows/azure-deploy-docker.yml` - CI/CD
- ✅ `docs/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Full guide
- ✅ `DOCKER_QUICK_REF.md` - Quick reference

### Option 2: Use Python Kusto SDK Instead

**What it is:** Remove the MCP server dependency and query Kusto directly using Python.

**Pros:**
- ✅ No Node.js needed
- ✅ Works with current deployment (no changes to Azure)
- ✅ Better performance (no process spawning)
- ✅ Native Python integration
- ✅ Uses your existing Managed Identity authentication

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires refactoring code to replace MCP calls
- ⚠️ Need to rewrite Kusto query logic

**What needs to change:**
```python
# Before (MCP server):
kusto_service = await get_kusto_service()
result = await kusto_service.query(database, query)

# After (Python SDK):
from azure.kusto.data import KustoClient, KustoConnectionStringBuilder
kcsb = KustoConnectionStringBuilder.with_azure_token_credential(
    cluster_url, auth_service.credential
)
client = KustoClient(kcsb)
response = client.execute(database, query)
```

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Docker Container | Python SDK |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| **MCP Server** | ✅ Works | ❌ Removed |
| **Node.js Available** | ✅ Yes (v22 LTS) | ❌ No |
| **Deployment Complexity** | Medium (one-time setup) | Low (current setup) |
| **Development Experience** | ✅ Same as local | ⚠️ Code changes needed |
| **Performance** | Good | ✅ Better (native) |
| **Build Time** | Slower (full image) | ✅ Faster (Oryx) |
| **Portability** | ✅ High | Medium |
| **Managed Identity** | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| **Setup Required** | Configure Azure for containers | Refactor code |

## My Recommendation: 🐳 Docker Container

**Why?**

1. **Keep your current architecture** - No code refactoring needed
2. **MCP server works** - Node.js is available in the container
3. **Easy testing** - Run `docker-compose up` locally to test
4. **Future-proof** - Can add other Node.js tools if needed
5. **Already implemented** - All files ready, just need to deploy

**Next Steps:**

See `DOCKER_QUICK_REF.md` for quick commands or `docs/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md` for full guide.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Test locally
docker-compose up -d

# Deploy to Azure (after one-time setup)
git push origin azure-app-service-deployment
```

## What About Azure App Service Node.js Support?

Yes, Azure **does** support Node.js natively, but that's for **pure Node.js apps** (like Express.js servers).

Your app needs **BOTH**:
- Python (for FastAPI backend)
- Node.js (for Kusto MCP server)

Azure App Service runtimes are **single-language**:
- Python runtime = Python only
- Node.js runtime = Node.js only
- .NET runtime = .NET only

To get **both Python AND Node.js**, you need a **custom Docker container**.

## Current Deployment Status

### Current (Code Deploy with Oryx):
```
Azure App Service
├── Python 3.11 ✅
├── FastAPI backend ✅
├── React frontend (built) ✅
└── Node.js ❌ (NOT AVAILABLE)
    └── Kusto MCP server ❌ (FAILS)
```

### After Docker Deployment:
```
Azure App Service (Container)
├── Python 3.11 ✅
├── Node.js 22 LTS ✅
├── FastAPI backend ✅
├── React frontend (built) ✅
└── Kusto MCP server ✅ (WORKS!)
```

---

## Testing Before Production

**Local Docker test:**
```bash
# Build and run
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Test app
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Stop
docker-compose down
```

**Verify Node.js is available:**
```bash
docker-compose exec app node --version
# Should show: v22.x.x

docker-compose exec app npm --version
# Should show: 10.x.x
```

## Summary

✅ **Docker container deployment is the way to go** because:
- Solves your Node.js problem
- Minimal disruption (no code changes)
- Easy to test and debug
- Production-ready solution
