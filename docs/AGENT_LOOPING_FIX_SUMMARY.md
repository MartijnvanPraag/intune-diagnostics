# Agent Looping Fix - Final Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-14  
**Issue**: Agent Framework with Magentic orchestrator continuously looping - agent executes queries but never completes  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

---

## Problem Evolution

### Original Issue (Session Start)
- Agent calling both legacy tools (lookup_scenarios) and new MCP tools (search_scenarios)
- Double work being performed
- Legacy scenario lookup still registered

### Issue #2 (After Legacy Tool Removal)
- Agent still looping after removing legacy tools
- Calling search_scenarios and get_scenario multiple times
- Device Timeline instructions referencing removed tools
- No completion criteria in agent instructions

### Issue #3 (After Instruction Fixes)
- F-string formatting error from dictionary literal in agent instructions
- Azure OpenAI content filter triggered by aggressive language (MANDATORY, CRITICAL, NEVER)

### Issue #4 (After Language Softening)
- **Agent executes queries successfully but orchestrator detects "stalling"**
- **Orchestrator resets and replans, causing infinite loop**
- **Root cause: Task lacks explicit completion criteria for progress ledger evaluation**

---

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the Magentic source code (`_magentic.py`), discovered:

### How Magentic Determines Completion

**Every round**, the orchestrator:
1. Calls `create_progress_ledger()` 
2. Uses LLM to evaluate: "Is the request fully satisfied?"
3. Checks the response: `is_request_satisfied.answer`
4. If `True` → calls `prepare_final_answer()` and completes
5. If `False` → continues orchestration

### The Progress Ledger Prompt

```python
ORCHESTRATOR_PROGRESS_LEDGER_PROMPT = """
...
- Is the request fully satisfied? (True if complete, or False if the 
  original request has yet to be SUCCESSFULLY and FULLY addressed)
...
"""
```

### Why Agent Was Looping

1. **Task**: "Device Timeline for DeviceId X"
2. **Agent**: Executes all 9 queries successfully ✅
3. **Agent behavior**: Executes tools, receives results, but doesn't generate user-facing response ❌
4. **Progress ledger evaluation**:
   - LLM sees: Queries executed
   - LLM sees: No formatted response to user
   - **Result**: `is_request_satisfied: False`
5. **Orchestrator**: Continues sending instructions
6. **After N rounds**: `is_progress_being_made: False` → stall count increases
7. **After max_stall_count**: Reset and replan → **infinite loop**

### The Missing Piece

**The task definition must include explicit completion criteria** so the orchestrator's progress ledger LLM knows when to return `is_request_satisfied: True`.

❌ **Vague**: "Device Timeline for DeviceId X"  
✅ **Explicit**: "Device Timeline for DeviceId X. COMPLETE when queries executed AND results presented to user"

## Complete Solution

### Fix 1: Remove Legacy Tool Registration
**File**: `backend/services/agent_framework_service.py`  
**Lines**: ~600-610

Removed legacy tool registration:
```python
# REMOVED: self.lookup_scenarios_tool
# REMOVED: self.lookup_context_tool
```

### Fix 2: Update Agent System Instructions (5 issues fixed)
**File**: `backend/services/agent_framework_service.py`  
**Lines**: ~661-730

1. **Removed outdated device_timeline instructions** referencing removed tools
2. **Removed aggressive language** (MANDATORY, CRITICAL, NEVER) that triggered Azure content filter
3. **Added completion criteria**: "After executing queries, MUST respond with formatted results"
4. **Fixed parameter names**: `values` → `placeholder_values` for substitute_and_get_query
5. **Clarified workflow**: "search → get_scenario → execute queries → RETURN RESULTS → DONE"

### Fix 3: Fix F-string Error
**File**: `backend/services/agent_framework_service.py`  
**Lines**: ~723-741

Removed dictionary literal from example code:
```python
# BEFORE: {"DeviceId": "abc-123", ...}  # Caused f-string error
# AFTER: Plain text description
```

### Fix 4: Increase Orchestrator Limits
**File**: `backend/services/agent_framework_service.py`  
**Lines**: ~983-984

```python
max_round_count=50,  # Increased from 20
max_stall_count=5,   # Increased from 3
```

### Fix 5: Add Explicit Completion Criteria to Tasks ⭐ **KEY FIX**
**File**: `backend/services/agent_framework_service.py`

#### Location 1: Generic tasks with history (Lines 1337-1365)
```python
guardrail = """
...
TASK COMPLETION CRITERIA:
The task is COMPLETE when ALL of the following are satisfied:
1. All required queries have been executed successfully
2. Query results have been formatted and presented to the user
3. A summary or analysis has been provided based on the results
The task is NOT complete if queries are executed but no response is given to the user.
"""
```

#### Location 2: Generic tasks without history (Lines 1350-1380)
```python
composite_task = (
    f"{message}\n\n"
    "TASK COMPLETION CRITERIA:\n"
    "The task is COMPLETE when:\n"
    "1. All necessary information has been gathered (queries executed if needed)\n"
    "2. Results have been formatted and presented to the user\n"
    "3. A clear response addressing the user's request has been provided\n"
    "The task is NOT complete until a user-facing response is given."
)
```

#### Location 3: Device Timeline specific task (Lines 1055-1095)
```python
timeline_instructions = (
    ...
    "TASK COMPLETION CRITERIA:\n"
    "The Device Timeline task is COMPLETE when ALL of the following are satisfied:\n"
    "1. All 9 Device Timeline queries have been executed successfully (or attempted if errors occur)\n"
    "2. Results have been formatted into tables and a timeline visualization\n"
    "3. A summary of findings has been provided to the user\n"
    "4. The final response includes the narrative summary, query list, and mermaid timeline block\n"
    "The task is NOT complete if queries are executed but no formatted response with timeline is given to the user.\n"
)
```

## How The Fix Works

### Before (Infinite Loop)
```
Round 1-5: Agent executes queries
Round 6: Progress ledger: is_request_satisfied=False (no user response)
Round 7-9: Agent continues
Round 10: Progress ledger: is_progress_being_made=False (repeating)
Round 11: Stall count = 4, RESET
Round 12+: Agent starts over (search_scenarios again)
... INFINITE LOOP ...
```

### After (Completes Successfully)
```
Task: "Device Timeline... COMPLETE when results presented to user"

Round 1-5: Agent executes queries
Round 6: Agent formats results, returns response to user
Round 7: Progress ledger evaluates:
  - Task says: "COMPLETE when results presented to user"
  - Agent provided formatted response ✅
  - is_request_satisfied=True ✅
Round 8: Orchestrator calls prepare_final_answer()
DONE ✅
```

## Testing Verification

### ✅ Code Compilation
```bash
cd c:\dev\intune-diagnostics\backend
uv run python -c "from services.agent_framework_service import AgentFrameworkService; print('✓ Import successful')"
# Output: ✓ Import successful
```

### Next: End-to-End Testing

Run Device Timeline scenario:
```
Device Timeline for [DeviceId]
```

**Expected Results**:
1. ✅ Agent calls `search_scenarios` only once (at start)
2. ✅ Agent calls `get_scenario` only 1-2 times (not 4+)
3. ✅ Agent executes all 9 Device Timeline queries sequentially
4. ✅ Agent returns formatted response with:
   - Summary of findings
   - List of executed queries
   - Mermaid timeline visualization
5. ✅ Orchestrator detects completion: `is_request_satisfied: True`
6. ✅ No "Stalling detected. Resetting and replanning" messages
7. ✅ Total execution: ~20-40 rounds (not infinite)

**Log Checks**:
```
[Magentic] Running workflow with message: ...TASK COMPLETION CRITERIA...
[Magentic] Progress evaluation: satisfied=False (rounds 1-N)
[Magentic] Progress evaluation: satisfied=True (after agent responds)
[Magentic] Task completed
[Magentic] Received WorkflowOutputEvent - task completed
```

## Key Insights

### 1. Magentic Uses Progress Ledger for Completion Detection
- **NOT** agent returning a special token
- **NOT** a callback or explicit signal
- **The LLM-based progress ledger evaluation** determines completion

### 2. Task Phrasing is Critical
The task passed to `workflow.run_stream(task)` must include:
- **What to do**: "Execute Device Timeline queries"
- **When it's done**: "COMPLETE when queries executed AND results presented"

Without explicit completion criteria, the LLM evaluating progress can't determine if the task is satisfied.

### 3. Agent Instructions + Task Completion = Success
Both are needed:
- **Agent instructions**: Tell the agent to respond after executing queries
- **Task completion criteria**: Tell the orchestrator when to detect completion
